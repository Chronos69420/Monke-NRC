    <p><b>Electric Vehicles</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Also referred to as battery electric vehicles</li>
      <li>Have an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine</li>
      <li>Electric vehicles use a large traction battery pack to power the electric motor and must be plugged in to a wall outlet or charging equipment, also called electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE)</li>
      <li>Because they run on electricity, the vehicles emit no exhaust from a tailpipe and do not contain the typical liquid fuel components, such as fuel pumps, fuel lines, or fuel tanks</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Embracing Electric Vehicles (Singapore)</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>$30 million to be set aside over the next 5 years for initiatives related to electric vehicles</li>
      <li>Minimum Additional Registration Fee (ARF) will be lowered to $0 from January 2022 to December 2023</li>
      <li>Planning to deploy 60,000 charging points at public car parks, private premises by 2030</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Effective?</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>As of June 2021, only about 1,500 electric vehicles were registered in Singapore
        <ul>
          <li>Only about 0.2% of the 640,247 cars on the road</li>
          <li>Albeit steady increase</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>WHY?
        <ul>
          <li>Cost of electric vehicles are still generally higher</li>
          <li>Lack of charging stations around the island at present making charging cars less convenient</li>
          <li>Shorter driving distance between charges compared to driving distance of other cars between refueling</li>
          <li>Longer charging time compared to refueling time</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Sources of Pollution</b></p>
    <p>Total U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emmisions by Economic Sector in 2019</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Agriculture: 10%</li>
      <li>Commercial & Residential: 13%</li>
      <li>Industry: 23%</li>
      <li>Electricity: 25%</li>
      <li>Transportaion: 29%</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Transportation is a primary source of greenhouse gases in the United States</li>
      <li>One of the largest sources of transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions is passenger cars</li>
      <li>The majority of greenhouse gas emissions from transportation are CO<sub>2</sub> emissions resulting from the combustion of petroleum-based products, like gasoline, in internal combustion engines</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Reduction of pollution of electric vehicles</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        200 grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per mile for electric vehicles in the U.S. on average (Currently)
        <ul><li>With the cleaning up of the electric grid, it is projected that about 75% of these emissions can be reduced to about 50 grams per mile by 2050.</li></ul>
      </li>
      <li>404 grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per mile for average passenger vehicles.</li>
      <li>No more tailpipe emissions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Assuming that vehicles drive about 11,500 miles per year:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2,346,000 grams (2.346 metric tonnes) of CO<sub>2</sub> will be saved for each electric vehicle in terms of consumption by driving.</li>
      <li>No more methane or nitrous oxide (both of which have much higher global warming potential than CO<sub>2</sub> albeit produced in smaller amounts compared to CO<sub>2</sub>) produced from tailpipe emissions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Battery productions for electric vehicles are the biggest emitter in the production of electric vehicles, especially those made in gigafactories powered by fossil fuels (causing about 30%-40% extra in production emissions compared to current vehicles)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>But having realised that this is a huge carbon footprint, realising that raw materials needed for battery production are in limited supply, and finding disposing batteries possible more expensive due to regulations, many companies are already working to ensure significant capacity to recycle batteries.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Why Electric Vehicles in particular?</b></p>

    <p>Why not #TEAMSEAS?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A global campaign to raise $30 million to fund the removal 30 million pounds (~13,607,771 kg ) of plastic and trash from our ocean, rivers and beaches</li>
      <li>Essential in protecting our marine ecosystems</li>
      <li>Short-term, one-off event albeit effective</li>
      <li>Does not really solve the root cause of the problem</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Why not reduce methane emissions?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>As mentioned above, methane is much more efficient than carbon dioxide at trapping radiation despite its shorter lifetime in the atmosphere</li>
      <li>Pound for pound, the comparative impact of CH<sub>4</sub> is 25 times greater than CO<sub>2</sub> over a 100-year period</li>
      <li>Agriculture is the largest source of methane emissions in the United States</li>
      <li>Domestic livestock such as cattle bred for food produce large amounts of methane as part of their normal digestive process</li>
      <li>Animal manure also produces large amounts of methane when stored or managed in lagoons or holding tanks</li>
      <li>Issue at hand: Industrial-scale beef production is impacting global climate</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Feeding cows a type of red algae seaweed can reduce the amount of methane they release from both ends by as much as 80 per cent</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>While the cows released up to 750 per cent more hydrogen than before - a result of producing less methane, hydrogen, unlike methane, has minimal impact on the environment</li>
      <li>Highly effective method in reducing emissions</li>
      <li>In Australia, environmental biotechnology company Sea Forest was awarded a $1 million commercialisation grant from its government to fast track seaweed production for use as cattle and livestock feed</li>
      <li>Mr Sam Elsom, chief executive of Sea Forest, said that the grant will fast track the company's ability to scale and supply the supplement to farms across Australia and globally</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Electric vehicles really do help with reducing greenhouse gas emissions greatly</li>
      <li>This heavy investment in pushing out electric vehicles is definitely necessary in paving the way for cutting emissions from the transport sector</li>
      <li>All methods, no matter short-term or long-term, must be implemented as soon as possible together, in order to stop us from finishing the global carbon budget, and keeping us from doing so far into the future</li>
    </ul>
